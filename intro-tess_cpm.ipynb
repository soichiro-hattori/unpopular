    "## **Causal Pixel Model (CPM)**\n",
    "I'll skip the details of how CPM works, but if you're interested you should take a look at the original papers ([Wang et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PASP..128i4503W/abstract), [Wang et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171002428W/abstract), and [Sch√∂lkopf et al. 2016](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7391) for a more theoretical explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core assumption behind CPM is that **common light curve variations across distant pixels are likely to be systematic effects**. This assumption is based on the idea that while we would **not** expect multiple distant stars to simultaneously show the same variation, *TESS* systematics (e.g., spacecraft jitter, scattered light) **would** simultaneously affect multiple distant pixels.\\\n",
    "Therefore, variations in a single pixel's light curve that can be modeled as a linear combination of many other *distant* pixels' light curves are probably systematic effects. CPM tries to capture these common variations in a single pixel so that it can be subtracted from the original pixel flux measurements to provide a \"de-trended\" pixel light curve."
