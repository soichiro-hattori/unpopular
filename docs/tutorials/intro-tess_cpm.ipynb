    "## **Causal Pixel Model (CPM)**\n",
    "I'll skip the details of how CPM works, but if you're interested you should take a look at the original papers ([Wang et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PASP..128i4503W/abstract), [Wang et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171002428W/abstract), and [Schölkopf et al. 2016](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7391) for a more theoretical explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core assumption behind CPM is that **common light curve variations across distant pixels are likely to be systematic effects**. This assumption is based on the idea that while we would **not** expect multiple distant stars to simultaneously show the same variation, *TESS* systematics (e.g., spacecraft jitter, scattered light) **would** simultaneously affect multiple distant pixels.\\\n",
    "Therefore, variations in a single pixel's light curve that can be modeled as a linear combination of many other *distant* pixels' light curves are probably systematic effects. CPM tries to capture these common variations in a single pixel so that it can be subtracted from the original pixel flux measurements to provide a \"de-trended\" pixel light curve."

    "*TESS-CPM* requires a reasonably large cutout since CPM works by using many other distant pixels as the model's features (regressors, predictors).\\\n",
    "We've recently been using 100x100 pixel cutouts, but the smallest cutout we've used was a 32x32 pixel cutout. One thing to keep in mind is that these FFI cutouts take up quite a bit of space (${\\sim} 250~\\mathrm{MB}$ for a 100x100 pixel cutout from one sector) and can also take a while to download.\\\n",
